## üö´ Critical Demo Avoidances

### DO NOT Do These:
1. ‚ùå **Load template THEN try AI modifications**
   - Reason: Different data structures, AI won't recognize activities
   - Result: Modifications won't apply

2. ‚ùå **Use both "more beach time" AND "add another day"**
   - Reason: Both create Day 5, will conflict
   - Choose one per demo

3. ‚ùå **Click customization options in template modal**
   - Reason: Visual only, doesn't apply to final itinerary
   - Just click "Load Template" immediately

4. ‚ùå **Try AI modifications beyond the 5 working ones:**
   - ‚úÖ Working: cooking class, beach time, spa, add day, snorkeling
   - ‚ùå Won't work: hotel changes, remove activities, transportation, dietary changes, cultural tours, budget requests

5. ‚ùå **Mention template accommodations/meals**
   - Reason: Only activities show in preview
   - Focus on activities only

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Template sidebar won't open
**Solution**: Type destination in "Destination" field, not "Itinerary Name"

### Issue: AI modification didn't apply
**Solution**: Check if you loaded a template first (not supported). Start fresh without template.

### Issue: Day 5 shows wrong content
**Solution**: You used both "more beach" and "add day". Refresh and choose only one.

### Issue: Price seems wrong
**Solution**: Multiply displayed price by number of travelers (system shows total)
